# AED I Project 2023-2024: ¡Toma 6!

## Overview
¡Toma 6! is not just a game for the faint-hearted! In this classic filler game, designed by the indefatigable Wolfgang Kramer in 1994, players must strategically play their 10 cards across four rows. However, each row can only accommodate five cards. Placing a sixth card in any row forces you to take the first five cards along with their negative points (bueyes). Our project aims to implement the exciting gameplay of ¡Toma 6! in Java, following the rules and mechanics described by Wolfgang Kramer.

## Game Mechanics
- **Players**: 2 to 10 players can select a card to play simultaneously.
- **Cards**: The deck consists of 104 unique numbered cards, each with a specific number of "bueyes" (bullheads) indicating negative points.
- **Objective**: Avoid accumulating points by strategically placing cards in rows. The game ends when a player reaches or exceeds 66 points.

### Special Card Rules
- Cards ending in 5: 2 bueyes.
- Multiples of 10: 3 bueyes.
- Multiples of 11: 5 bueyes.
- Card 55 is special: 7 bueyes.

## Setup
- Shuffle the deck of 104 cards.
- Deal 10 cards to each player.
- Place 4 cards on the table to start the game.

## How to Play
The game consists of an undetermined number of rounds, where each round has 10 turns. Players play their cards from lowest to highest, adhering to specific placement rules. When a player places the sixth card in a row, they must take the first five cards, scoring the accumulated bueyes.

## Project Organization
This project is a collaborative effort among 4/5 students, utilizing Java and the NetBeans IDE. Each team member is responsible for their contribution and for staying in communication with the group.

## Deliverables
There will be three functional deliveries throughout the project, guided and evaluated by the instructor. Each delivery involves a group presentation, contributing to the project's final evaluation.

## Evaluation
The final evaluation comprises:
- A group tutorial, accounting for 20% of the final grade.
- An individual computer-based exam on June 5, 2024, making up 25% of the final grade.
